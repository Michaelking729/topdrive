# TOP DRIVE – Agent Instructions

## Goal
Build a prototype web app for TOP DRIVE (InDrive-like flow):
- Rider sets pickup + destination
- Show estimated fare
- Create a "request ride" state
- Driver view can see requests (mock for now)

## Tech
- Next.js (TypeScript)
- Tailwind
- Use mock data first
- Keep shared types in /packages/shared

## Commands
- Install: npm install
- Dev: npm run dev
- Lint: npm run lint
- Build: npm run build

## Rules
- Prefer small PR-sized changes
- Write clear commit messages
- Keep components reusable for mobile later
